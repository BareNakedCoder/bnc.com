:summary: Welcome to *yet another blog* site on computing technologies.
    Just what the web needed!
    In this first post I briefly describe the purpose for this blog
    as well as the design decisions for hosting it.

**TL;DR**:
I started this blog to regain the writing skills I once had.
To minimize the financial costs of this blog, I decided to do it as a
static web site generated with `Pelican <http://getpelican.com/>`_
and hosted on `Google App Engine <http://cloud.google.com/appengine>`_.

This Blog's Purpose
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Back when people in my workplace used to read more, I used to write more.
But over the years as people read less, I wrote less.
That wasn't intended. It just happened. Now when I *do* try to write,
I find the words do not flow as easily as they once did.

This is not good. But can be reversed.
The writing muscle can get back into shape through regular exercise.
Having a real audience motivates, focuses, and inspires higher quality writing.
Even if that audience is small or imaginary.
So a public blog it shall be instead of a private journal.

The benefits of this blog will be mostly personal, intangible, and
non-financial. I ain't gonna get rich doing this ... but I do hope to
become a better writer and a more purposeful thinker.
If I do write gooder, you might find some value in this too.

This Blog's Design Decisions
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

This blog will be about whatever happens to be on my mind.
On my mind lately has been the design decisions I've made for
building and hosting this blog.
Future blog posts will likely discuss each in greater detail
... but for now, here are the results at a high-level.

Building - Static Site with Pelican
########################################################################

If you have neither the skill, time, nor desire to build, customize, and/or host your own blog site ...
if you prefer to just write ... choose a hosted ready-to-go blog solution
like `Wordpress.com <https://wordpress.com/>`_
or `Blogger <https://www.blogger.com/>`_.

I have a little of all three, so I was willing to spend a little time
(but not a lot) on a more customized blog.
